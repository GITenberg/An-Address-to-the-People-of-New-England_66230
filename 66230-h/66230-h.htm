ADDRESS, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">My Design in this Address is to represent,
to the People in this Country, the very
great Importance of treating the <em>Indians</em>,
who live among us, and upon our
Borders, in a just, kind and charitable Manner; and
that we do, by all proper Means and Methods, endeavour
to attach them to us, and to the <em>British</em> Interest.
This, I apprehend, is a Subject that has been too
much neglected, and that greatly wants to be set in
a clear and just Light. And I sincerely wish that
some Gentleman of greater Abilities and Address
than I can pretend to, would take it in Hand: Tho’
if my weak Endeavours may be a Means of moving
others to do Justice to a Subject of such Weight,
I shall heartily rejoice in it.</p>

<p>That I may offer what I have to say in the clearest
and most concise Manner I can, I shall go into
the following Method.</p>

<p><em>First</em>, I shall endeavour to shew, that it is of vast
Importance to the <em>British Provinces</em> and <em>Colonies</em> in
<em>America</em>, especially to the Provinces of the <em>Massachusetts</em>,
<em>New-York</em>, and <em>New-Hampshire</em>, that they
be in good Terms with the <em>Indians</em>, and attach
them to their Interest. And,</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, I shall endeavour to shew, by what
<em>Means</em> this may be effected: Or what are the most
likely Methods to bring it to pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p>1. I am to shew, that it is of vast Importance,
that we be in good Terms with the <em>Natives</em>; and
that we engage them in our Interest. I freely grant,
that the <em>Indians</em>, simply considered, are not of such
great Consequence to us. We can subsist without
them. But yet, their Trade is a considerable Article,
worthy the Care of any politick People, and
managed as it might, and ought to be, would yield
us great Profit. But if we consider them with Relation
to <em>Peace</em> and <em>War</em>, as attached to us, or to
our <em>Enemies</em>, they are of the last Importance to us;
for they certainly have the Ballance of Power in their
Hands, and are able to turn it for or against us, according
as they stand affected to us. <em>Canada</em>, inconsiderable
as it is, and from which, separate from
the <em>Indians</em>, we have little or nothing to fear in
Time of War; <em>Canada</em>, I say, would be more than
a Match for us, in case they join with them against
us. He must be a great Stranger to, and very ignorant
of, the Circumstances both of the <em>English</em> and
<em>Indians</em>, who is not sensible of this. Our Circumstances
are such, that we cannot guard ourselves
against the Incursions of such Enemies in Time of
War; for our <em>Frontiers</em> are of vast Extent, and
border upon the adjacent Wilderness; which, tho’
almost inaccessible to us, yet is the very Element in
which they delight to live. They are at Home in
it. The People therefore who inhabit our Frontiers,
while they follow their necessary Business, are exposed
to be an easy Prey to them; and many of them have
been surpriz’d in their Fields and Houses, and in a
most barbarous Manner put to Death. A small
Number of <em>Indians</em>, encouraged and supported by the
<em>French</em> (which they are ready enough to do) can
easily keep us in a constant Alarm, put us to an
immense Charge, destroy many, and impoverish
more, in our exposed Places, and not put themselves<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
at all out of their Way; yea, find their Account
in it; for as they live by Hunting, so where Game
is most plenty they are best off: And where can they
find a better Supply, than among our Cattle, Sheep,
and Corn-Fields? There they live at Ease, distress
and impoverish us, and the adjacent Wilderness is
their Refuge. By retiring into it, they are soon out
of our Reach; and long Experience has taught us
how ineffectual the Measures we have taken for our
Safety and Defence have proved.</p>

<p>Some, I am sensible, will say, let us not be at
any Cost and Pains to gain the Friendship of such
a perfidious Crew, but let us destroy them all.
Quickly said indeed, but not so soon nor so easily
effected. Those Persons who are for destroying
them would doubtless soon do it, were they first
bound and delivered up to them. But one Question
here is, how we shall get them into our Power?
And another is, Whether it would be so humane,
generous and Christian-like, to take away
their Lives, were that in our Power, as it would be
to cultivate Friendship with them, and to seek their
best Good? If we should be so sanguine as to endeavour
to destroy them, it would doubtless prove
a vain Attempt; and serve only to drive them to
the <em>French</em>, who would be very ready to receive and
protect them. If we neglect them, and take no
Measures to engage them in our Interest, or to cultivate
Friendship with them, this will probably render
them indifferent to us, and dispose them to
hearken to the enticing Insinuations of <em>Romish</em> Emissaries;
and our Situation must be very unhappy,
when they become engaged in the <em>French</em> Interest.</p>

<p>If it be objected, that the <em>French</em> have already
gained a large Number of <em>Indians</em> to their Interest,
and therefore if we use our best Endeavours to
gain others, it will avail nothing; for those who are<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
devoted to the <em>French</em>, will nevertheless distress us
in Time of War. I reply,</p>

<p>It is very true, that the <em>French</em> of <em>Canada</em>, thro’
their Policy and Vigilance, have taken the Advantage
of our Neglect, and gained a large Number
of the <em>Natives</em> to their Interest, and are gaining
more and more every Year; and some even from
among our own <em>Indians</em>. They spare neither Cost
nor Pains to accomplish their Designs of this Nature,
being sensible enough how advantageous it is
to them, and how injurious to us; and if they continue
to be active, and we negligent, as in Times
past, is it not too probable that they will, in a little
Time, attach to themselves all the <em>Indians</em> in
<em>North-America</em>? Does it not then concern us to
use proper and vigorous Endeavours to prevent this
apparent Mischief, by counter-working the <em>French</em>?
who are, I suppose, tampering with all the Tribes of
<em>North-America</em>, to engage them in their Interest.
And should we succeed in our Endeavours (as it is
highly probable we might, if proper Steps were
taken) so as to engage the <em>Five Nations</em>, and some
other Tribes, in hearty Friendship with us; and
especially if we should bestow such Favours upon
them, as would induce them to settle upon our
Frontiers; it would in all Probability prevent the
Evil spoken of in the Objection; for the <em>Indians</em>
from <em>Canada</em> would not molest us, if a Number of
the Natives, in hearty Friendship with us, were
placed in our Borders. Of this we have had a very
plain Proof the last War, in the Safety of <em>Stockbridge</em>,
and the adjacent Places, from any Attempts
of the Enemy from <em>Canada</em>.</p>

<p><em>Stockbridge</em> is in the very Road of, and more exposed
to, the <em>Indians</em> from <em>Canada</em>, than any other
Place whatever; and yet we see that the Enemy
turned off East to <em>Connecticut-River</em>, and West to<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
the <em>Dutch</em> Settlements, where they did much Mischief;
while <em>Stockbridge</em>, <em>Sheffield</em>, <em>New-Marlborough</em>,
and <em>Number One</em>, tho’ more exposed, were not molested.
This, so far as we can discern, was owing
to a small Number of <em>Indians</em> dwelling at <em>Stockbridge</em>,
who are our hearty and fast Friends; which
the Enemy being sensible of, cared not to come
within their Reach, lest they should be taken in
their own Snare. And if we should encourage
the Settlement of other <em>Indian</em> Towns upon our
Frontiers, where Hunting is most handy to them, as
<em>Stockbridge</em> has been encouraged; should we give
them Townships of Land suitable for their Improvement,
build a Meeting-House and School-House in
each Town, and support Ministers and School-Masters
in them; would not this convince them that
we are their true Friends, and seek their Good?
Would it not induce them to settle in our Borders?
especially those of them who are desirous that they
themselves and their Children should be instructed?
Would they not be a Guard to us in Time of War?
And if, after all, we should meet with some Trouble
from the <em>Indians</em> of <em>Canada</em>, might it not be effectually
prevented, by playing our <em>Indians</em> upon
them, as they do theirs upon us? And would not
the Charge of all this be a Trifle, compared with
that of defending ourselves in Time of War? But
if we neglect them, and take no Measures to cultivate
Friendship with them, and especially if we deal
injuriously by them, shall we not put an Advantage
into the Hands of the <em>French</em> (which they will not
fail of improving) to engage them in their Interest,
and to employ them against us in Time of War?
which would prove a very great Calamity to us, if
not our utter Ruin. These Things considered, is it
not of very great Importance, that we be at good
Terms with the neighbouring <em>Natives</em>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>2. I will, in the next Place, endeavour to shew
what are the likely <em>Methods</em> to bring this to pass:
Or what Measures we must take with the <em>Indians</em>,
if we would engage them in hearty Friendship with
us.</p>

<p>And here, in general, our Conduct towards them
must be such as shall make them sensible that we are
indeed their hearty Friends; and such also as shall
convince them that it is their Interest and Advantage
to be in Friendship with us. Nothing short of
this, I apprehend, will attach them to us, so as to
answer the Ends proposed. If we often treat with
them, renew the Friendship, and bestow upon them
large Presents: Or, as they phrase it, Smoke together,
brighten the Chain, or put the Brands together,
to kindle up the former Fire; and yet leave
Room for them to suppose that this proceeds not from
true Friendship, but rather from Fear of them, or
from Suspicion that they will join with our Enemies,
&amp;c. this will never be sufficient to engage them;
the utmost we can rationally expect from it is, that
they will not openly break with us, but keep up a
Shew of Friendship, that they may have the Benefit
of future Presents at our Hands.</p>

<p>Again, if we should by any Means convince them
that we are their true Friends, and yet not go into
such Measures with them as should turn to their <em>Advantage</em>,
they would hardly be engaged for us. As
all other People are governed by <em>Interest</em>, so are
they. And the principal Handle we can take hold
of, to attach them to us by, is their <em>Interest</em>, and
that would not fail of doing it. If a Tribe of
<em>Indians</em> can sell their Skins to us for <em>Twenty Shillings</em>,
and buy their Blankets for <em>Ten Shillings</em>; they will
never go to <em>Canada</em> where they must sell their Skins
for <em>Ten Shillings</em>, and give <em>Twenty Shillings</em> for a Blanket.
Convince them that it is much for their Interest<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
and Advantage to be our Friends and Allies, and we
need not fear but that they will be so. Now, in order
to convince them that we are truly their Friends,
and that it is their Interest to be ours, we must,</p>

<p>In the first Place, treat them according to the
Rules of Equity and Justice. We must not defraud
and oppress them, but be honest and just in our
Dealings with them.</p>

<p>The Natives, with whom we have to do, are Persons
of so much Sagacity, that they can distinguish
between just and injurious Treatment, as well as
other Men. They are also as ready to resent, and
perhaps more forward to revenge Injuries, than any
other People under Heaven. If therefore we treat
them in an unjust Manner, we may rationally expect
that they will be so far from being our Friends, that
they will join with our Enemies, and seek Opportunities
of Revenge.</p>

<p>It is well known, that the <em>Indians</em> are generally
addicted to Drunkenness, and that when they have
tasted a little Liquor, they have a strong Thirst for
more, and will part with any Thing they have, for
a sufficient Quantity to make them drunk.&mdash;&mdash;And
is it not as well known, that we have taken the Advantage
of this their vicious Appetite, and for a few
Quarts of Rum have purchased valuable Effects of
them? Have not private Persons thus made their
Gains of them, notwithstanding the good Laws
that have been in Force to prevent it? And is not
this the Manner of all private Traders, who go
among their several Tribes for Gain?</p>

<p>In our publick Dealings with them at our Truck-Houses,
where Rum has been freely sold them,
Care has been taken that they should not be cheated,
but that they should have the full Value of what
they had to sell: An Indian therefore, who was
Owner of a Pack of Beaver, Deerskins, or any other<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
valuable Goods, could buy a large Quantity of
Rum, and might get drunk perhaps ten times, or
more; whereas, if he had fallen into private Hands,
he must have contented himself with being drunk
but once or twice. Which of these proves most injurious
to <em>Indians</em> in the End, I shall not pretend
to determine.</p>

<p>When they are thus intoxicated, they fall out among
themselves, fight, and sometimes kill, one
another, and some have drunk themselves dead on
the Spot. An Instance of each of these there has
been, if I am rightly informed, at <em>Fort Dummer</em>,
since that has been improved as a Truck-House.
And whether the Guilt of that Blood does not lie
upon us, I leave others to judge.</p>

<p>Now, if we treat the <em>Natives</em> in this Form, will
they, can they, live with us? Will not the Law of
Self-Preservation oblige them to leave us, and to go
where they may be better used? Some of the <em>Five
Nations</em> plainly speak it out, and say, “We cannot
live with the <em>English</em> and <em>Dutch</em>; they bring us so
much Rum, that it destroys us; we must go to the
<em>French</em>, who will let us have but little strong Drink.”
Thus we alienate the <em>Indians</em> from us, and as it
were oblige them to go over to the <em>French</em>, who are
often our Enemies, and fail not to employ them against
us in Time of War. And if we proceed to
deal thus injuriously with them, what can we expect
but that they will leave us, and be a severe Scourge
to us?</p>

<p>Tho’ the <em>Indians</em> are sunk below the Dignity of
human Nature, and their Lust after Drink exposes
them to be cheated out of what little they have; yet
this gives us no Right to deal unjustly by them.
They have a natural Right to Justice, and may,
with great Propriety, challenge it at our Hands, seeing
we profess to be subject to the Laws of <em>Christ</em>,<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
which teach us to do <em>that which is altogether just</em>.
And we should be so far from taking the Advantage
of their Ignorance, Vice and Poverty, to defraud
them of what is their just Right, that we should rather
be moved to Pity, and compassionate their deplorable
State, and be <em>Eyes to the Blind</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I am fully persuaded, that if we were upright and
just in all our Transactions with them; if our Trade
with them was put into the Hands of faithful Men,
who would deal justly by them; and if they were supplied
with all Necessaries for themselves and Families
at a moderate Price, it would not be in the Power of
all the <em>French</em> at <em>Canada</em> (subtle as they are) to alienate
them from us. The <em>French</em> are not upon equal Ground
with us in this Affair. For their Northern Climate
is much more inhospitable and severe than ours is:
Their Country is not so productive of those Fruits,
which the <em>Indians</em> very much live upon, as ours:
Nor can they afford Goods which are proper and
necessary for the <em>Indians</em> at so cheap a Lay as we
can: Therefore we can give them those Advantages
which <em>Canada</em> cannot. We can, without Damage
to ourselves, make it their Interest to adhere to us:
And when Experience has once taught them, that
their Interest lies with us, they will want no other
Inducement to engage them to us: Yea, it will
not only attach those of them to us, who are
not yet gone to <em>Canada</em>, but it will induce those who
are, to return to their Brethren, for the Sake of the
Profit they might reap by it; especially if we give
them all the Advantage we can, consistent with our
own.</p>

<p>As unjust and abusive Treatment of the <em>Indians</em>
tends naturally to alienate them from us, and to turn
them off to the <em>French</em>; so a Series of just and
faithful Dealing with them would be likely to attach
them to us, and to make them our fast Friends.<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
This again appears from the Temper and Conduct
of that Part of the <em>Tribe</em> of the <em>River Indians</em> who
live at <em>Stockbridge</em>. For tho’ they were, for a considerable
Time, extremely jealous, that we had
some ill Design upon them, even in the Favours
they received at our Hands (a Jealousy founded, I
suppose, upon the ill Usage the <em>Natives</em> have too
often been the Subjects of) yet by the just Treatment
they, for a Course of Years, have met with
from the <em>Government</em>, from Mr. <em>Sergeant</em>, Mr.
<em>Woodbridge</em>, and others, they are become our hearty
Friends; willing to live or die with us, whether in
Peace or War.</p>

<p>It is very true, that in order to obtain the End
proposed, our Trade with the <em>Indians</em> must not be
in private Hands. It must not be in the Power of
every private Person to treat them as he pleases.
We may upon good Grounds despair of their being
treated with Equity and Justice, if every one
may gratify his avaricious Temper in dealing with
them. Our Trade therefore must be of a publick
Nature, and must be committed to the Care and
Management of faithful Men: Not to such as will
seek the Service, and make Friends to procure the
Post for them; (certain Indications of a Self-seeker)
but Men of Uprightness and Integrity must be sought
out; such, and such only, must be trusted with Business
of such Importance: Good Instructions must
be given them, which must be carefully adhered
to.</p>

<p>If the <em>Indian</em> Trade at <em>Canada</em> was in private
Hands; if every private Person there might deal
with the <em>Indians</em> at Pleasure, we might then hope
that those who are gone from us would soon return;
for, in that Case, it is supposable enough that they
would not meet with much better Usage there than
they do here; tho’ it is scarcely supposable that they<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
would meet with much worse. The <em>French</em> Trade
with the <em>Indians</em> is wholly in the Hands of publick
Officers, (it I am rightly informed) and a private
Man, if he wants a Dear-skin, a Beaver-skin, &amp;c.
is not allowed to purchase of an <em>Indian</em>, but must
go to the publick Stores. Upon the Supposition
that those Officers are faithful, and deal justly by the
<em>Indians</em>, it is surely a wise and politick Method to
engage them in their Favour. And so long as every
private Person in the English Government is at Liberty
to trade with them, when, and where, he pleases,
and to cheat them out of what they have, what
can we expect but that they will repair to <em>Canada</em>,
where they may be better used? Is it not owing to
the ill Treatment they have met with from the <em>English</em>
and <em>Dutch</em>, that so many of them are gone
already? And if no proper Measures are taken to
prevent their being ill used, will not those who are
yet behind soon follow their Brethren? Yea, if we
furnish them with large Quantities of Rum, make
them drunk, and then defraud them of what they
have, do we not reduce them to a Necessity, either
of living low and miserable with us, or of going from
us, that they may fare better? How low, how
dispirited, how miserable and brutish these few are,
who live within our Borders, is too manifest. And
whether we, by our ill treating of them, have not
contributed to their Misery, is worthy of our serious
Enquiry. Yea, would it not be proper for us to
enquire, Whether we have not, by our Neglect and
Abuse of them, provoked Heaven to let loose the
Natives upon us, who have been one of the sorest
Scourges that we were ever chastised with? What
Multitudes have they, in a most cruel Manner,
murdered in our Borders? How many of our Neighbours
have they led into Captivity? Some of whom
have been redeemed at a very great Expence, and<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
others are become either Pagans or Papists, and continue
still in a foreign Land. And who can count
the Cost we have been at, to defend ourselves against
their Incursions?</p>

<p>If the British Government should be disposed, in
Time to come, to set up and maintain a publick,
honest and just Trade with the <em>Five Nations</em>, or any
other Tribes, thereby to attach them to us, to promote
their true Interest, with other valuable Ends, that
might thereby be answered; this Objection perhaps
would arise, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> That such a Proceeding will be a
very great Expence to the Publick, for our Trade
cannot be safe, unless it be protected by a considerable
Force. A Fort must be built, and a Garrison of 50,
60, or perhaps 100 Men, with their proper Officers,
must be maintained at each Place where the Trade
is set up; therefore the Advantage would not
countervail the Cost. To this I reply,</p>

<p>If such Garrisons should be thought necessary in
the Places where a Trade is set up, to be a Guard
to it, the Charge would nothing like equal that of an
Indian War, which perhaps it might prevent.</p>

<p>But further, I apprehend that the Charge of such
Garrisons might be spared; and that, instead of being
necessary, they would prove very injurious to the
Design; and that it would be a very wrong Step to
be taken in that Affair.</p>

<p>All who are in any good Measure acquainted with
the <em>Indians</em> know, that they are extreamly jealous,
lest any Incroachments should be made upon them;
and it is not strange it should be so, considering what
has past over them. And if a Number of armed
Men were placed among them, and Forts built for
the Defence of our Trade, they would be suspicious
that something hostile was intended, and we
should not be able to remove the Suspicion. They<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
would behold us with a jealous Eye, and perhaps
take Measures to frustrate the whole Design.</p>

<p>The most effectual Way to induce them to trust
us, is to trust them; and they will be ready enough
to protect our Trade if we desire it, and shew that
we confide in them to do it. And when a little Experience
has taught them how advantageous such a
Trade would be to them, they would be ready enough
to do it for their own Advantage. If therefore
we should desire them to admit a Trader into
one of their own Forts, or to build a Fort at our
Charge in some convenient Place for such a Design,
and to take Care that our Trade be safe; this
would tend to convince them, both of our Friendship
to, and of our Confidence in, them; and they
would not only be pleased with it, but also ambitious
to shew us that we may safely trust them: And
were I to be the Truck-Master, I should esteem
myself much safer in their Protection, than in a
Garrison of 100 <em>English</em> Men: For if such a Garrison
should be placed among them, they themselves
would suspect some ill Design carrying on against
them; and the <em>French</em> would infallibly tell
them, that tho’ we pretended Peace and Friendship,
yet our Design in the End is to dispossess them
of their <em>Country</em>.</p>

<p>If indeed a Truck-Master should prove an unfaithful
Servant, and enrich himself by defrauding
them, he might have Occasion for <em>English</em> Soldiers
to protect him and his Stores; but if they found
him faithful, friendly and just in his Dealings with
them, they would be as careful of him as of their
own Eyes, and venture their own Lives for him.
What would not the <em>Indians</em> of <em>Stockbridge</em> have
done for Mr. <em>Sergeant</em> in his Day, whom they had
found to be their true and hearty Friend? And what
would they not now do for Mr. <em>Woodbridge</em>, of<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
whom the have had the like Experience? <em>Indians</em>
will be as ready as the <em>English</em>, and perhaps much
more so, to serve and protect, if there be Occasion,
those whom they have found to be their faithful and
real Friends.</p>

<p>In a Word, I apprehend, that if we had in
Times past treated the Natives according to the
Rules of Equity and Justice, it would have been quite
sufficient to have engaged them in our Interest, and
to have kept them in Amity and Friendship with us;
and that, even now, they might in a little Time be
attached to us, by such Treatment: But this, I
confess, I despair of, if every private Person must
be left at his Liberty to treat them as he pleases, and
to defraud them of all they have; which I take to
be the Case in <em>New-York</em> Government, who lie next
to the <em>Five Nations</em>, and have their Trade; tho’ in
this <em>Province</em> we have good Laws in Force to restrain
private Persons from selling them strong Drink.</p>

<p>2. We should also exercise that Kindness and Generosity
towards them, that shall convince them
that it is for their Interest to be in Friendship with us.
We should not, in a Case of such Importance, content
ourselves with being barely just in our Treatment
of them, but we should also be kind and generous,
as a proper Expedient to obtain the End
proposed. I am aware, I shall here be quickly interrupted
with this Exclamation;</p>

<p>What! <em>kind</em> and <em>generous</em> to such an ungrateful
evil Crew! To which I shall only answer, We have
good Authority for being <em>kind to the Unthankful, and
to the Evil</em>. And if that good Being who recommends
it to us, had not given an Example of it, in
his Dealings with us, how deplorable had our State
been? This kind Temper and Behaviour is recommended
to us in the Gospel, not only because it is
the Will of our heavenly Father that we should be<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
kind, but also because the Exercise of it answers excellent
Ends; produces very good and desirable
Effects; such as Love, Friendship, Peace, &amp;c.
And while we make a Profession of Christianity, it
is Pity the Practice of it, in so material an Article,
should be objected against. And is it not very proper
that we should exercise Kindness and Generosity
to the poor Natives, when there is a strong Probability
of its being of very happy Consequence both to
them and us?</p>

<p>A great deal of Kindness and Generosity has been
exercised towards the River <em>Indians</em> at <em>Housatunnuk</em>,
by this <em>Government</em>, by the honourable <em>Corporation</em>
at Home, by their honourable and reverend <em>Commissioners</em>
at <em>Boston</em>, by the Rev. Mr. <em>Hollis</em>, by the
Rev. Mr. <em>Sergeant</em>, Mr. <em>Woodbridge</em>, and others;
and the Consequence has been very happy as to
them; they are brought to the Knowledge of the
Gospel, and to a Christian Profession; and many of
them, we hope, to the saving Knowledge of God.
We also have found the Benefit of this kind Usage
of them; for thereby they are become our hearty
Friends, are united to us in their Affections, and
were a Means, in the Hand of Providence, of covering
our most Western Frontiers the last War.
And were the like Kindness shewn by us to other
Tribes, is there not Room to hope that the Effects
might be alike happy? If Townships, suitable for
<em>Indians</em> to settle in, were provided in our Frontiers,
and it were proposed to them, that if they would come
and settle in them, they should not only enjoy the
Land as their own, but also have a Minister supported
among them to instruct them in the Christian
Religion; and also a School-Master to teach their
Children to read and write; would not this induce
many of them, especially of the better Sort, to
come and settle in our Borders? And would they<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
not cover our Frontiers in case of a War with
<em>France</em>?</p>

<p>What has been done for the <em>Indians</em> at <em>Stockbridge</em>,
has doubtless been much observed and approved of
by the <em>Natives</em> far and near. That there is a School
set up at <em>Canada</em>, in Imitation of Mr. <em>Sergeant</em>’s
School at <em>Stockbridge</em>, and a large Number of Scholars
in it, we have heard and receive for Truth.
That the <em>French</em>, who esteem Ignorance to be the
Mother of Devotion, and do not desire to teach the
<em>Indians</em> any Thing more than to say their Beads, and
to cross themselves, have done this out of Choice,
is not at all likely. They do not desire that their
<em>Indians</em> should become a knowing People. But yet,
being sensible that the Report of Mr. <em>Sergeant</em>’s
School had spread itself far and wide, and that their
<em>Indians</em> were pleased with the Method the <em>English</em>
had taken to furnish the <em>Natives</em> with Knowledge,
they apprehended, that unless something like it were
done among them, there would be Danger
of the <em>Indians</em> repairing to us for Instruction, and
to prevent this, and to engage them to themselves,
they set up their School. This, I conjecture, is the
Truth of the Case. And if so, it is manifest that
the <em>Indians</em> are inclined to seek after Knowledge;
and therefore would be disposed to hearken to such
kind and generous Proposals, if they were made to
them. And who can tell but that this, that, or the
other Tribe, would gladly settle such Towns, if
they were invited to it in a proper Manner?</p>

<p>3. Another Step, and perhaps the most promising
one we can take, to engage the <em>Indians</em> in Friendship
with us is, to send Missionaries among their
respective Tribes, Ministers and Schoolmasters, to
instruct them in the Principles, and to persuade them
to the Practice of Christianity. Tho’ they have so
long lived near us, and been conversant with us, yet<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
they remain ignorant of the Way of Salvation,
Strangers to the Gospel, and are perishing for lack
of Knowledge: A Case that might well move our
Pity and Compassion towards them, and put us upon
doing what we can for their Relief. And whether
our former Neglect of Things of this Nature
has not been provoking to Heaven, may be worthy
of our serious Enquiry.</p>

<p>The Interest the Rev. Mr. <em>Barclay</em> had in the
<em>Mohawks</em>, while he was with them, the Reformation
of Manners he wrought among them, their
Willingness to receive Instruction, and their Engagedness
to prosecute Learning, are a plain Indication
that faithful Missionaries would be welcome to
them. And the <em>Five Nations</em> being nearest us, and
their Friendship of very great Consequence, it might
be proper to begin with them: And what has been
done among them by Mr. <em>Barclay</em> and others,
might be no small Help in the Case. If we should
send Persons well qualified for the Business to reside
among them, and support them well, there would
be no Foundation for any Jealousy that we have an ill
Design upon them, and if at any time such Jealousies
should arise, they would soon subside, upon the <em>Indians</em>
having a little Experience of our Kindness and
Friendship to them. The prudent Conduct and
faithful Labours of such Missionaries might, by the
Blessing of God, serve to remove their Barbarity,
correct their Manners, reform their Lives, promote
in them virtuous Sentiments, and by Degrees form
them to true Religion. This we may hope would
be the happy Event, with Respect to many of them,
tho’ not to all; and if, by much Labour and Expence,
it might be brought to pass, should we not
find our Account in it; for what would be the
Charge of supporting a few Missionaries, compared
with that of an <em>Indian</em> War? And is there not great<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
Probability that such Measures would in a few Years
Time attach them to us in a hearty Friendship?
And if the <em>Five Nations</em>, who are a Terror to, and
have in great Measure the Command of, other
Tribes, were indeed our Friends, and made so by
such Obligations laid upon them, would it not be
an effectual Means of restraining other <em>Indians</em> from
giving us Trouble in case of a War?</p>

<p>The general Objection here, I am sensible, will
be;&mdash;There is no Likelihood of succeeding, and
therefore it is not worth While to make any Trial;
it would only be to spend Labour and Money to no
good Purpose. To which I reply,</p>

<p>How can we draw the Conclusion before we have
made the Experiment? Have we ever made any proper
Trial, and found ourselves disappointed? And can
it be looked upon just to draw such a Conclusion,
in a Case of such Importance, unless we had better
Grounds for it?</p>

<p>It is true, Mr. <em>Sergeant</em> made a Visit to the <em>Susquehanna
Indians</em>, Mr. <em>Brainard</em> also, in his Day,
did the same, without Success; but we know that
the Excuse those <em>Indians</em> made was, that they held
their Lands of the <em>Five Nations</em>, and therefore could
not comply with such a Motion, till their Consent
was first obtained. And besides, shall we esteem
two or three Visits made by private Persons a sufficient
Trial in this Case? Sufficient indeed it was to
shew that those good Gentlemen were possest of an
excellent Spirit, and of a laudable Zeal for the Good
of the poor Natives; but yet I apprehend not sufficient
to discourage further Attempts. If those
Gentlemen, who went in a private Capacity, had
sustained a publick Character, perhaps they had been
more regarded. But however, when we have used
our best Endeavours, and they indeed prove unsuccessful,
we may be excusable; but can we look<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
upon ourselves so, if we sit still, and use no Endeavours
for the Help of those poor benighted People?</p>

<p>If proper Attempts should be made for Christianizing
the <em>Five Nations</em>, there would, I am sensible,
some notable Difficulties lie in the Way, but
yet perhaps none but what might be surmounted.</p>

<p>One Difficulty that would doubtless attend such a
laudable Undertaking, would arise from those who
maintain a private Trade among them, from which
they reap great Gain; especially by the Article of
Rum, too much of which they convey to them,
and by the Influence of which the <em>Indians</em> are easily
defrauded.</p>

<p>These Traders would be very sensible, that if Christianity
should prevail among those <em>Nations</em>, the
<em>Hope of their Gain</em> would be <em>gone</em>, and <em>seeing by this
Craft they have their Wealth</em>, they would use their
utmost Endeavours to dissuade the <em>Indians</em> from
embracing the Ways of Religion. They in Fact did
so at <em>Housatunnuk</em>, where the Number of <em>Indians</em>
was small, and their Trade not so considerable. How
much more then will they do it, if Endeavours should
be used to convert the <em>Mohawks</em>, whose Trade is
vastly more advantageous? But as the <em>Indians</em> at
<em>Housatunnuk</em>, by Mr. <em>Sergeant</em>’s Help, saw thro’
the Artifice they used, and were made sensible of
the selfish Views of the Traders, so doubtless the
<em>Five Nations</em> may easily be informed, and the Obstruction
soon removed.</p>

<p>Another Difficulty will arise from the false Insinuations
of <em>Romish</em> Emissaries, who will not fail to tell
them, that we are about to teach them a false Religion,
and if they hearken to us, they will all certainly
be damned. But when those <em>Indians</em> are properly
informed of the Conduct of the <em>French</em>, and
other Roman Catholicks, how they deny the Use of
the Bible to the common People among themselves,<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
and that they have no Design to acquaint the <em>Indians</em>
with the Word of God: And on the other
Hand, that our Design is not to impose upon them,
but to open the Bible to them, to enable them to
read it, and to judge for themselves; will not this
satisfy them of our honest Intentions towards them,
and of the Safety and Propriety of their examining
Things, that they may form a Judgment for themselves?</p>

<p>A third, and perhaps much the greatest Difficulty
that would attend this good Design is, that those
<em>Indians</em> esteem themselves Christians already, and
value themselves upon their being as good Christians
as their Neighbours. Mr. <em>Sergeant</em>, in his Journal
of <em>November</em> 25, 1734, says,&mdash;‘The <em>Mohawks</em> are
generally Professors of Christianity, but for want
of Instruction have but little of it in Reality.&mdash;’
They are so ignorant of the Principles of Religion,
that they know not the Difference between one who
is baptized, and calls himself a Christian, and one who
lives agreeably to the Rules Christ has given us to
walk by. They are not sensible of the Necessity of
being conformed to those Rules of Virtue and Holiness
which Christ has prescribed. <em>Romish</em> Emissaries
have baptized some of them, others (as I have been
informed) have been baptized by <em>Dutch</em> Ministers;
and they esteem it a Privilege belonging to them to
have their Children baptized, whenever they present
them, without any Regard being had, either to the
Qualifications of the Parent, or the religious Education
of the Child. When the Rev. Mr. <em>Spencer</em>
was among them a few Years ago, they were
much displeased that he declined baptizing some
Children, whose Parents were notoriously ignorant,
vicious and wicked. Some <em>Indians</em> from <em>Canada</em>,
who had an <em>English</em> Woman to their Mother, came
a few Years past to <em>Westfield</em> to visit their <em>English</em><span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
Relations there, and while they staid at that Place,
they had a Child born, and were much offended
with the Rev. Mr. <em>Balantine</em>, who declined baptizing
of it, as they desired. Since the Rev. Mr.
<em>Edwards</em> has been at <em>Stockbridge</em>, one of the <em>Mohawks</em>
residing there had a Child born, and was
highly affronted because Mr. <em>Edwards</em> did not baptize
it upon his Desire. From these Instances it is
evident, that they account their Children have Right
to Baptism, whenever they desire it. And being
baptized, they esteem them good Christians, whatever
their Conversation may be; for they derive
their Notions of Christianity, not from the Bible (to
which they are Strangers) but from the Example of
the <em>Dutch</em> and <em>French</em>, with whom they are conversant,
and who profess themselves to be Christians.</p>

<p>And so far forth as being baptized, in the forementioned
Manner, and calling themselves Christians
will make them so, they are so to be esteemed.
Now these Things being so, it may prove a difficult
Thing to make them sensible, that Drunkenness, and
other vicious Practices, are inconsistent with Christianity;
because those Christians, who fall under their
Observation, give them an Example of Vice, and
go such Lengths therein.</p>

<p>But yet I apprehend this Difficulty might also be
removed, by giving them a just and true Account
of the Nature and Extent of the Christian Religion,
by informing them what the Will of <em>Christ</em> is; how
he expects that we should be conformed to his Likeness,
and to his Laws. The <em>Indians</em> are as capable
of hearing Reasons, and giving them their Weight,
as other Men; and it is because they know not
what Christianity is, that they esteem themselves
Christians, in their present Circumstances. When
they are made acquainted with the Terms of Salvation,
proposed in the Gospel, and what they must<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
do that they may inherit eternal Life; when they
are well instructed in the Doctrines of <em>Christ</em>, they
will be sensible that the Religion which they now
have, is little or nothing like that which is taught
by the Gospel. When Mr. <em>Edwards</em> refused to baptize
a <em>Mohawk</em> Child born at <em>Stockbridge</em> (which I
have before mentioned) and they were very much displeased
with him on that Account, he went to them,
gave them the Reasons of his Conduct, and informed
them as clearly as he was able, of the Nature
and End of Baptism: Those <em>Indians</em> received the
Force of his Reasons, and appeared to be satisfied
and contented, when he had taken Pains to inform
them. And I doubt not but proper Instruction and
Information would remove the Difficulty I have
been speaking of.</p>

<p>Tho’ Christianizing those <em>Indians</em> may prove a
difficult Work, yet if our Endeavours might, by
the divine Blessing, be succeeded, would not the
Advantage thence arising to them, and us, more
than compensate the Pains and Expence we should
be at? And is there not so much Ground to hope
for Success, as should induce us to make the Experiment?</p>

<p>I shall now conclude, by briefly suggesting a few
Things, not yet mentioned, the serious Consideration
of which may excite us to use our best Endeavours
for the Conversion of the neighbouring <em>Indians</em>
to the Christian Faith.</p>

<p>1. And in the first Place, should not the Consideration
of the divine Bounty and Goodness, bestowed
upon us, excite us to employ Part of that
undeserved Goodness to promote the Knowledge of
God, our bountiful Benefactor, among those who
are destitute of it? Thro’ the undeserved Favour
and Blessing of God, we have been prosperous in
our secular Affairs, succeeded in our Husbandry,<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
Trade, &amp;c. and are become a wealthy People:
And, were we as willing as we are able, might we
not spare large Sums for the Propagation of the Gospel
among the Heathen? Ought we not then to
shew our Gratitude to the glorious Author of all
our Comforts, by employing a Part of his Bounty to
promote the Redeemer’s Kingdom? Is it not fit
that we should thus <em>honour the Lord with our Substance</em>?
Does it not lie as a Reproach upon us, who
make an high Profession, that we expend so little to
promote the Knowledge of God among the <em>Natives</em>,
and so much to ill Purposes? Were what we
employ in unnecessary Expences, by which Pride
and Luxury are indulged and nourished, employed
in the laudable Method I am recommending; would
it not be sufficient well to support a Multitude of
Missionaries among the neighbouring Tribes? Would
it not probably be a Means of turning many of them
<em>from the Power of Satan to God</em>? And would it not
be <em>an Odour of a sweet Smell, a Sacrifice acceptable,
well pleasing to God</em><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>? And seeing God, by his
Blessings, has enabled us to contribute to such a
good Design, should we not chearfully give of our
Substance, for the spiritual Benefit of the perishing
Heathen?</p>

<p>2. Should not the Light and Grace of the Gospel,
which we, thro’ divine Goodness enjoy, be a
stronger Argument still to excite us to endeavour the
Conversion of the Heathen?</p>

<p>A few Generations back we were in a State of
Heathenism, as they now are: <em>Aliens from the Commonwealth
of Israel&mdash;and without God in the World</em><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.
But, thro’ divine Goodness, <em>the Day-spring from on
High has visited us</em>, and we enjoy the Light and
Privileges of the Gospel-Dispensation. Seeing then
God has had Compassion on us, and bestowed upon
us those richest Blessings, ought we not to have<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
Compassion on the neighbouring Heathen, and
use our best Endeavours that they also may be made
Partakers of the Light and Blessings of the Gospel?</p>

<p>3. Should we not be moved to such charitable
Endeavours from the Consideration of the wretched
and forlorn Circumstances, in which the poor <em>Natives</em>
appear before our Eyes? We often behold those
piteous Objects, appearing half naked, and almost
starved; which is the Effect of their vicious Way
of Living. We see them also in the Depths of Ignorance
and Barbarity; wholly unacquainted with
the Way of Salvation, and quite unconcerned for
their eternal Good: And yet their Powers, both of
Body and Mind, are not inferior to our own. Were
they brought to Civility and Industry, they might
stand upon equal Ground with us, respecting the
Comforts of Life; and were they instructed in divine
Things, made acquainted with the great and
important Truths of the Gospel, they might stand
as fair for the Kingdom of Heaven as we do. Should
not our Eyes therefore affect our Hearts, when we
behold them in such miserable Circumstances? And
should we not exert ourselves in all proper Ways for
their Help? Did the Wounds of the poor Man <em>half
dead</em>, who <em>fell among Thieves</em>, plead with so much
Eloquence for human Compassion, as the unhappy
State of the poor <em>Natives</em> does for Christian Charity?
And if the Compassion of a <em>Samaritan</em> was moved
by the former, how much more should the
Bowels of a <em>Christian</em> be moved by the latter?</p>

<p>4. The noble Example of some generous and pious
Persons, at Home, may well excite us to liberal
Contributions for the Benefit of the poor Heathen.</p>

<p>Not only publick Societies, but also private Persons,
in <em>Great-Britain</em>, have generously and liberally
contributed for the Benefit of the <em>Natives</em>, in this
distant Part of the World. Tho’ they are at 3000
Miles Distance, and never beheld, as we do, those<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
miserable Objects; yet, from a truly pious and generous
Spirit, they have sent over their liberal Contributions,
that the Heathen, by their Means, may
be informed in the Way of Life. <em>Verily, they shall
not lose their Reward.</em> A noble Example they set
before us, most worthy our Imitation: And how
can we excuse ourselves, if we neglect to copy after
it? Some indeed may plead their Inability, but this
is not the Case of all. Are there not among us many
wealthy Merchants and Traders? Are there not
also many Farmers, who abound in Wealth, upon
the Lands which were, a few Years ago, the Property
of the <em>Indians</em>, who now stand in Need of
their Charity? Should not such Persons be moved,
by the generous Examples of others, to help forward
the noble Design of converting the Heathen?
Yea, are not the People in general able to do something
to help forward so good a Design? And will it
not lie as a Reproach upon us, if we, who make a
high Profession of Religion, prove void of Charity,
when we are so loudly called to the Exercise of it,
not only by the laudable Example of generous Benefactors
at Home; but also by the perishing Circumstances
of the neighbouring <em>Indians</em>?</p>

<p>I shall only add my hearty Wishes, that this <em>American</em>
Continent, which, for Ages unknown, has
been a Seat of Darkness, and <em>full of the Habitations
of Cruelty</em>, may become a Scene of Light and

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
